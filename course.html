                There are a great many course you can choose from, some of them free and some of them costing a small fortune.  If you are coming from a place with no previous qualification or experience, and your aim is to get a 
                job within the tech world at the end of it all, then you need to make sure that whichever qualification you gain from all your efforts will be recognised by potential employers.
                I think there are some amazing free resources out there and they can really help to broaden your knowledge of code and begin your journey of becoming a software engineer.  
                But a gentle warning - be cautious with some free courses that you are not being taught less-than industry standard.  You may become a whizz at creating websites, but if you are doing it in your own, unique way, this 
                could lead to problems of other engineers not being able to understand your code and you will be less attractive to potential employers.

            <h2>The package <i class="fas fa-box-open"></i></h2>
            <p>
                Another point to consider is the after-care - will your course provider give you useful, up-to-date information on how to enter the job market once you've gained your qualification so you can land your first role as a 
                Software Engineer?  And more than that, will they help you write your CV, go through mock interviews with you, and guide you in the world of networking so you can meet your future employer?
                A lot about becoming a Software Engineer is being able to sell yourself and that's not necessarily in what qualificatons you have or sometimes even experience.  What can you offer? Do you have a stella work ethic? 
                Are you amazing at multi-tasking? Is your strength working as a team member and getting the most out of people? And are you willing to learn and constantly strive to increase your knowledge? You may not have a Masters
                Degree, but you still have a lot to offer backed up by a industry recognized qualification and a platform to showcase your skills (LinkedIn anyone?!).

            <p>
                With all this in mind, the course which suited all of my needs, met all of these points and gave me the confidence to take my first step, was the Full Stack Developer Course with the Code Institute and the Learning People.
                I believe that if you are to encourage complete newcomers to enter this world, especially women, people from ethnic minority groups and people from the LGBTQ+ community, then a holistic approach is the best approach; 
                you are unique, and you will have unique needs and wants and the right course with the right company will not only start your learning, but help you grow into the potential employee businesses are looking for, 
                and I think this course will get you (and myself!) and other like-minded people to where we want to be.
