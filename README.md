## Objective
In my first project I want to create a useful and informative website for anyone who is looking to becoming a Software Designer.  I want to showcase my ability in HTML and CSS.  My aim is to develop a site which is visually pleasing and informative with intuitive navigation and a clear purpose.

## Brief
### **Coding for Beginners - A Holistic Approach**
The goal of this website is to provide a brief, personal approach to making your way into the world of code and becoming a Software Developer.  I believe strongly that we are all individuals and whichever course you go for has to fit all of your needs to give you the best chance of succeeding.  I have biased my findings in favour of the Full Stack Developer Course at The Code Institute and The Learning People.  I have intended for the information given to be geared towards being holistic as well as provding links to The Code Institute course and a contact form for any suggestions.

## UX; User Experience Design
### Colors
I used HTML Color Codes(www.https://htmlcolorcodes.com) for a color palette and Hex colors.  I wanted something quite muted and calming so that the text and images would stand out clearly against the background.
I used the color picker to choose the hover color on the button for the contact form.  I wanted the color to compliment the images on the home and contact pages.
ADD SCREEN GRAB FROM HTML COLOR CODES . COM
### Typography
I used Google Fonts(https://fonts.google.com/) for the fonts Cinzel and Play.  I felt that Cinzel looked contemporary and professional, and Play complimented it for the main bodies of text keeping the content clear and readable.
https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cinzel?query=cinzel#standard-styles
https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Play?query=play#standard-styles
ADD SCREEN GRAB OF BOTH FONTS 
### Images
I was inspired by the use of Font Awesome Icons(https://fontawesome.com/icons) in the Love Running Project section of the course, so I decided to make each of the headers more eye-catching with a relevant icon, copying the HTML code for each icon before posting it into the relevant sections.  Below is an example of the icon I used on the setup page for the heading 'Your work space'.
ADD SCREEN GRAB OF FONT AWESOME SITE LAPTOP-HOUSE AS AN EXAMPLE
All the images I used for my project were taken from Pexels(https://www.pexels.com/).  The images I used for index.html and contact.html were largly calm and muted colors and subject, with soft colors and a relaxed scene.  The image I used for the header and footer elements is a partial view of a flower which I feel compliments the overall feel of the site.  The images for each of the h2 elements are relevant to the title and paragraph content.
### Animations and Transitions
When you first open the home page the image zooms in slightly which adds a fun element and draws the viewers eye to the image and text within the image.  I learnt how to do this whilst doing the Love Running Project within the course and used those learnt skills to implement it in my own project.
Below you will see a screen shot of the text displayed on mouse hover on the front image (but which is always displayed on screens less than 1200px).  I am very interested in what CSS can offer in terms of interactivity and I felt it added a pleasing visual to those viewing the site on a desktop.
ADD SCREEN SHOT OF FADE TEXT
I want the menu to have a contempory feel; to achieve this I put left and right borders on a memu item to highlight what page you are on, whilst also making it clear what page you have navigated to.  I have including just the left border on the menu list to highlight what menu page you can select before you have selected it which is is in contrast to both left and right borders.
ADD SCREEN SHOT OF BOTH IF POSSIBLE
To make it clear when you have the mouse hovered on the submit button as part of the form on the contact page, I changed the background color to a peachy color to match some of the colors in the images on the home and contact pages.
### Wireframes
I drafted a layout of my project using Balsamiq Wireframes.  I initially designed all content to be on the same page which is reflected in my original mockup linked below.  When doing the project I realised that due to the amount of content I was putting in this would become a bit too cumbersome, and so changed my layout whilst doing the project so that each section will have it's own page.

### Features
#### Header
I used the Cinzel font to add to the professional feel of the site.  I wanted an imge behind the text to aid visual impact and chose a neutral image containing part of a flower.  As I referenced plants later on it my site the use of a flower was not out of context.  I want the text to stay to the left so that it did not overlay the flower which could cause some of the letters to become lost in the image.  I had originally started with a different image but the colors were too dark and made the header too prominate detracting from the overall look I was going for.
ADD SCREEN GRAB OF HEADER
#### Footer
I followed much the same process for the footer that I did for the header, though made the text a smaller font so as to be clear this was a less important than the header and content of the page.  I also added a LinkedIn link by the way of the LinkedIn title image.
ADD SCREEN GRAB OF FOOTER.
#### Home page
I wanted to keep this simple, with an image that is relevant to the title of the site.  I added the zoom in of the image and the text fade-in to make it more engaging.
#### Setup, Course and Community pages
As each of these three pages have three sections to them, either by the way of paragraphs or videos, I wanted it to be clear to the user the definition between each one.  I used a soft cream color as the background and grey to the background of each div.  So whether
