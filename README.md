## Objective

In my first project I want to create a useful and informative website for anyone who is looking to becoming a Software Designer.  I want to showcase my ability in HTML and CSS.  My aim is to develop a site which is visually pleasing and informative with intuitive navigation and a clear purpose.
***

## Project Goals

The goal of this website is to provide a brief, personal approach to making your way into the world of code and becoming a Software Developer.  I believe strongly that we are all individuals and whichever course you go for has to fit all of your needs to give you the best chance of succeeding.  I have biased my findings in favour of the Full Stack Developer Course at The Code Institute and The Learning People.  I have intended for the information given to be geared towards being holistic as well as providing links to The Code Institute course and a contact form for any suggestions.  I wanted to give someone new to Coding an idea of what to expect and give them the basic tools, physical or otherwise, to get started.

## UX User Experience Design

### Overall User Experience

1. It has been designed as mobile first.  The user may use a number of different sized devices and the media queries reflect this so that the aesthetics of the site remain looking okay, and the site is accessible and readable across the majority of screen sizes.
2. The user can expect the header and menu to stay in the same position on every page so the title of the site is visible and the menu is always displayed at the top of the page making navigation easy and consistent for the user.
3. The image on the home page gives an indication as to what the site is about and the text very briefly and succinctly explains the site's purpose.
4. The footer remains the same format and contains the same information for every page and device ensuring that the user can always access the author and their LinkedIn profile.
5. The site is clearly set out with each page title making it clear to the user what the content will be.
6. The contact page allows the user to send suggestions to the author.  Once the form is submitted it takes the user to a thank you page but to be clear this form is NOT active as have still to learn how to do this, but it's there to show how to build a contact form with html and css.

### Design Choices

#### Colours

I used [HTML Color Codes](www.https://htmlcolorcodes.com) for a colour palette and Hex colors.  I wanted something quite muted and calming so that the text and images would stand out clearly against the background.
I used the colour picker to choose the hover colour on the button for the contact form.  I wanted the colour to compliment the images on the home and contact pages.  I chose a soft cream colour for the background for all the pages to be less harsh than just the white.

#### Typography

I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for the fonts [Cinzel](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cinzel?query=cinzel#standard-styles) and [Play](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Play?query=play#standard-styles). I felt that Cinzel looked contemporary and professional, and Play complimented it for the main bodies of text keeping the content clear and readable.

![Screenshot 2022-02-28 at 13 58 08](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96961963/155995470-7c3e785b-5d73-4076-ad30-8680010a152a.png)

#### Images

I was inspired by the use of [Font Awesome Icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons) in the Love Running Project section of the course, so I decided to make each of the headers more eye-catching with a relevant icon, copying the HTML code for each icon before posting it into the relevant sections. Below is an example of the icon I used on the setup page for the heading 'Your work space'.

![Screenshot 2022-02-28 at 13 59 43](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96961963/155995721-fc42adde-c635-4410-9c94-818f184dfffb.png)

All the images I used for my project were taken from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/). The images I used for index.html and contact.html were largely calm and muted colours and subject, with soft colours and a relaxed scene. The image I used for the header and footer elements is a partial view of a flower which I feel compliments the overall feel of the site. The images for each of the h2 elements are relevant to the title and paragraph content.

#### Animations and Transitions

When you first open the home page the image zooms in slightly which adds a fun element and draws the viewers eye to the image and text within the image. I learnt how to do this whilst doing the Love Running Project within the course and used those learnt skills to implement it in my own project. Below you will see a screen shot of the text displayed on mouse hover on the front image (which is only displayed on a desktop). I am very interested in what CSS can offer in terms of interactivity and I felt it added a pleasing visual to those viewing the site on a desktop.

![Screenshot 2022-02-28 at 14 01 07](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96961963/155995926-c1488ee9-d9e6-4541-9f1a-99d34aad0ba2.png)

I want the menu to have a contemporary feel; to achieve this I put left and right borders on a memu item to highlight what page you are on, whilst also making it clear what page you have navigated to. I have including just the left border on the menu list to highlight what menu page you can select before you have selected it which is in contrast to both left and right borders. To make it clear when you have the mouse hovered on the submit button as part of the form on the contact page, I changed the background colour to a peachy tone to match some of the colours in the images on the home and contact pages.

### Wireframes

I drafted a layout of my project using [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/).  I initially designed all content to be on the same page which is reflected in my original mock-up shown below. When doing the project I realised that due to the amount of content I was putting in this would become a bit too cumbersome, and so changed my layout whilst doing the project so that each section will have its own page.

![Screenshot 2022-02-28 at 12 03 10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96961963/155996138-09f9f9ae-7bc8-4c01-93bc-81680fe81c75.png)

![Screenshot 2022-02-28 at 12 03 35](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96961963/155996155-95a67534-169f-48c4-98a2-d618362baf07.png)

### Features

#### Header

I used the Cinzel font to add to the professional feel of the site. I wanted an image behind the text to aid visual impact and chose a neutral image containing part of a flower. As I referenced plants later on in my site the use of a flower was not out of context. I want the text to stay to the left so that it did not overlay the flower which could cause some of the letters to become lost in the image. I had originally started with a different image but the colours were too dark and made the header too prominent detracting from the overall look I was going for.

![Screenshot 2022-02-28 at 14 23 27](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96961963/155999308-79e195d7-243b-407b-81a2-bba8cfebdd99.png)

#### Footer

I followed much the same process for the footer that I did for the header, though made the text a smaller font so as to be clear this was a less important than the header and content of the page. I also added a LinkedIn link by the way of the LinkedIn title image.

![Screenshot 2022-02-28 at 14 05 47](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96961963/155996625-fc2d2817-7c48-44d4-b182-ef9c8a37d145.png)

#### Home page

I wanted to keep this simple, with an image that is relevant to the title of the site. I added the zoom-in of the image and the text fade-in to make it more engaging.

![Screenshot 2022-02-28 at 14 24 05](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96961963/155999408-7368b1ba-fa0f-43c6-8ca4-f6dc5d88f155.png)

#### Setup and Course and Community pages

As each of these three pages have three sections to them, either by the way of paragraphs or videos, I wanted it to be clear to the user the definition between each one.  I used a grey background to each div to compliment the cream and same coloured font for all of the text.  I had to slightly adapt this on the Community page as I didn't have three headers and three blocks of text.  I was conscious I had been quite wordy on the other two pages so subsituted two paragraph sections for two videos to add some variety.  I chose to have each div on the Set-up and the Course pages to lay next to each other on bigger screen and stacked on top of each other on smaller screens so they would be readable.  The Community page was a little different so had the video side by side or stacked on top of each other but always under the div containing the text.  I felt this looked better than having a video each side of the text section when the screen was bigger.

![Screenshot 2022-02-28 at 14 08 08](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96961963/155996964-9cb7b0b2-dda2-4707-87bb-1ba4a126509f.png)

![Screenshot 2022-02-28 at 14 08 27](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96961963/155997019-be14a2fd-2453-4bf9-a866-455a51456c0e.png)

![Screenshot 2022-02-28 at 14 09 14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96961963/155997112-70664a07-42ec-49f1-a014-f21dde59ea82.png)

#### Contact page

I liked the idea of having one main image which both incorporated mindfulness / self-care and computing, and I think this image had it all!  Again it's fairly muted in terms of the vibrancy of the colours, and it leads nicely onto the contact form which I kept very simple but still functional.  

![Screenshot 2022-02-28 at 14 09 40](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96961963/155997169-318569d6-9204-4925-b4ff-dc73a4c63820.png)

#### 404 Error page

I was advised by my mentor to put a personalised error page so I used the same image for the Contact page and added a slightly humorous message including a link to the Home page.

#### Future Features

I would like to curve the edges of the grey background for each of the sections/divs just to soften the look a little, and I would love to expand on my experiences of the course so far and generally my journey into coding.  I really enjoy reading about other people's experiences and I would like to share what I have learnt along the way with the view of encouraging other people to take that first step.  I also feel that the layout of my site could look a little slicker, so I would change how the text plays over the image on the home page and make one section fade into the other on the other pages.  I would also make the fade text on the home page visible at all times if viewed on a mobile.

I also used the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) and [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) following the use of the above 2 validators; I was having a lot of issues getting the W3C validators to work originally hence the use of different validators originally.  For thoroughness sake I did run the code through these validators and it found 1 error in CSS on line 161 showing opacity: 1s.

### Cross Browser and Cross Device Testing

I have loaded the website in Chrome, Safari and Firefox. Each browser displayed the site as I designed it to, and the responsive design is functioning as I intended.
I have used a number of mobile device sizes in dev tools to ensure the website functions and appears OK across a number of devices.
I have inputted various formats of data into the form on the contact page, and the form requires all sections to be completed including a full email; if these things are not completed correctly it returns an error message. I have purposely not made the consent button as a required input.  When the form is submitted a new page is displayed thanking the user.
I've tested all the anchor elements for external links and ensured they open in a new browser tab.  I've also tested the internal anchor elements and ensured they go to the relevant pages within the site.
I've manually tested the user requirements as outlined in [Overall User Experience](#Overall-User-Experience).
I've ran my site through Lighthouse's audit [Web Dev](https://web.dev.measure/) and the results are below:

## Technologies Used

1. [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)
    - I used Balsamiq to create a very rough outline of the site and I added extensive paragraph content here too.

2. [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - I used icons from version 5 of Font Awesome

3. [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)
    - This was where I obtained all of my images - they are cost and royalty free and of good quality.

4. [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)
    - I started to become more comfortable with using this as the project went on and really saw how useful it is in de-bugging and making changes before commiting them on gitpod.

5. [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - I used Google Fonts as this was suggested within the course - there was a huge amount of choice which I really liked and it made it quite easy to pick fonts that I wanted.

6. [Favicon](https://favicon.io/)
    - My mentor introduced me to this as an optional extra and I decided to use it and am pleased with the result.

7. [HTML Color Codes](www.https://htmlcolorcodes.com)
    - I used this to firstly choose the colours and secondly to find out their hex values.

8. [Lighthouse's audit](https://web.dev.measure/)
    - This gave me a good indication as to how my site was performing, especially in relation to accessibility, best practices and search engine optimization.

9. [Web Accessibility](https://www.webaccessibility.com/) and [Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/)
    - Accessibility is to users with disabilities is incredibly important, so I chose these two tools in the final stages of my project to ensure I was on track with this important element of website design.

10. [W3C Markup Validation Service](validator.w3.org)
    - I copied the code from my html and css and ran it through the relevant checks via the direct input method.

11. [CSS Validator](https://www.cssportal.com/css-validator/)
    - I inputted my CSS via direct input into this tool.

12. [HTML Validator](https://www.freeformatter.com/html-validator.html)
    - I again used direct input one page at a time to check for errors.

## Credits

### Content

- I used content from fellow student Dave Horrocks' Readme file on his submitted first project [Katie Horrocks - Wildlife Photograhy](https://github.com/DaveyJH/ci-portfolio-one-v4/blob/main/README.md#Initial-Concept), in particular the Test and Technologies used section, and point 1 in Overall User Experience though I have heavily modified both of these to fit my project.
- I used the contact form from fellow student Anya Hush on her first project [Sunrise Yoga](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Submissions/sunrise-yoga) as a strong basis for my contact form.
- I used snippets of code from the answers on Stackoverflow for the question centred around how to fade in text on an image [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27883032/css-fade-out-picture-and-fade-in-text) for my home page.
- I have used code supplied to my by my mentor Malia Havlicek in particular in the css for my two YouTube videos, though went on to modify this supplied code to provide better user experience.

### Media

- As mentioned above, all images were taken from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)

### Acknowledgments

- I want to acknowledge Dave Horrocks who is a student on the same course; his help and support has been invaluable to me, especially at the start of the project when I was suffering from Imposter Syndrome and he was able to guide me though
  the process and make me believe in my abilities again.  
- My mentor Malia Havlicek, who has challenged me and provided insight into some issues I faced.  I have quickly learnt with Malia that she will not simply give me the answers but will be a guiding light in times of need!
