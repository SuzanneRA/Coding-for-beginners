## Objective
In my first project I want to create a useful and informative website for anyone who is looking to becoming a Software Designer.  I want to showcase my ability in HTML and CSS.  My aim is to develop a site which is visually pleasing and informative with intuitive navigation and a clear purpose.

## Brief
### **Coding for Beginners - A Holistic Approach**
The goal of this website is to provide a brief, personal approach to making your way into the world of code and becoming a Software Developer.  I believe strongly that we are all individuals and whichever course you go for has to fit all of your needs to give you the best chance of succeeding.  I have biased my findings in favour of the Full Stack Developer Course at The Code Institute and The Learning People.  I have intended for the information given to be geared towards being holistic as well as provding links to The Code Institute course and a contact form for any suggestions.

## UX; User Experience Design
### Colors
I used HTML Color Codes(www.https://htmlcolorcodes.com) for a color palette and Hex colors.  I wanted something quite muted and calming so that the text and images would stand out clearly against the background.
I used the color picker to choose the hover color on the button for the contact form.  I wanted the color to compliment the images on the index.hmtl and contact.html pages.
ADD SCREEN GRAB FROM HTML COLOR CODES . COM
### Typography
I used Google Fonts(https://fonts.google.com/) for the fonts Cinzel and Play.  I felt that Cinzel looked contemporary and professional, and Play complimented it for the main bodies of text.
https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cinzel?query=cinzel#standard-styles
https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Play?query=play#standard-styles
ADD SCREEN GRAB OF BOTH FONTS 
### Images
I was inspired by the use of Font Awesome Icons(https://fontawesome.com/icons) in the Love Running Project section of the course, so I decided to make each of the headers more eye-catching with a relevant icon, copying the HTML code for each icon before posting it into the relevant sections.  Below is an example of the icon I used on setup.html page for the heading 'Your work space'.
ADD SCREEN GRAB OF FONT AWESOME SITE LAPTOP-HOUSE AS AN EXAMPLE
All the images I used for my project were taken from Pexels(https://www.pexels.com/).  The images I used for index.html and contact.html were largly calm and muted colors and subject, with soft colors and a relaxed scene.  The image I used for the header and footer elements is a partial view of a flower which I feel compliments the overall feel of the site.  The images for each of the h2 elements are relevant to the text.
### Animations and Transitions
When you first open index.html the image zooms in slightly which adds a fun element and draws the viewers eye to the image and text within the image.  I learnt how to do this whilst doing the Love Running Project within the course and used those learnt skills to implement it on my own project.
Below you will see a screen shot of the text displayed on mouse hover on the front image (but which is always displayed on screens less than 1200px).  I am very interested in what css can offer in terms of interactivity and I felt it added a pleasing visual to those viewing the site on a desktop.
ADD SCREEN SHOT OF FADE TEXT
I want the menu to have a contempory feel; the left and ride borders on the memu highlighting what page you are on achieve this whilst also making it clear what page you have navigated to.  I have including just the left border on the menu list to highlight what menu page you can select before you have selected it which is is in contrast to both left and right borders.
ADD SCREEN SHOT OF BOTH IF POSSIBLE
To make it clear when you have the mouse hovered on the submit button as part of the form on contact.html I changed the background color.
