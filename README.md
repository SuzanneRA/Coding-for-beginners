## Objective

In my first project I want to create a useful and informative website for anyone who is looking to becoming a Software Designer.  I want to showcase my ability in HTML and CSS.  My aim is to develop a site which is visually pleasing and informative with intuitive navigation and a clear purpose.
***

## Brief

### Project Goals
The goal of this website is to provide a brief, personal approach to making your way into the world of code and becoming a Software Developer.  I believe strongly that we are all individuals and whichever course you go for has to fit all of your needs to give you the best chance of succeeding.  I have biased my findings in favour of the Full Stack Developer Course at The Code Institute and The Learning People.  I have intended for the information given to be geared towards being holistic as well as provding links to The Code Institute course and a contact form for any suggestions.  I wanted to give someoone new to Coding an idea of what to expect and give them the basic tools, physical or otherwise, to get started.

## UX; User Experience Design

### Overall User Experience

1. It has been designed as mobile first.  The user may use a numer of different sized devices and the media queires reflect this so that the aesthetics of the site remain looking okay, and the site is accessable and readable across the majority of screen sizes.
2. The user can expect the header and menu to stay in the same position on every page so the the title of the site is visible and the menu is always displayed at the top of the page making navigation easy and consistent for the user.
3. The image on the home page gives an indication as to what the site is about and the text very briefly and succinctly explains the site's purpose.
4. The footer remains the same format and contains the same information for every page and device ensuring that the user can always access the author and their LinkedIn profile.
5. The site is clearly set out with each page title making it clear to the user what the content will be.
6. The contact page allows the user to send suggestions to the author.  Once the form is submitted it takes the user to a thank you page but to be clear this form is NOT active as have still to learn how to do this, but it's there to show how to build a contact form with html and css.

#### Colours

I used HTML Color Codes(www.https://htmlcolorcodes.com) for a color palette and Hex colors.  I wanted something quite muted and calming so that the text and images would stand out clearly against the background.
I used the color picker to choose the hover color on the button for the contact form.  I wanted the color to compliment the images on the home and contact pages.  I chose a soft cream color for the background for all the pages to be less harsh than just the white.

#### Setup and Course and Community pages

As each of these three pages have three sections to them, either by the way of paragraphs or videos, I wanted it to be clear to the user the definition between each one.  I used a grey background to each div to compliment the cream and same coloured font for all of the text.  I had to slightly adapt this on the Community page as I didn't have three headers and three blocks of text.  I was conscious I had been quite wordy on the other two pages so wanted subsituted two secitons for two videos to add some variety.  I chose to have each div on the Set-up and the Course pages to lay next to each other on bigger screen and stacked on top of each other on smaller screens so they would be readable.  The Community page was a little different so had the video side by side or stacked on top of each other but always under the div containing the text.  I felt this looked better than having a video each side of the text section when the screen was bigger.

#### Contact page

I liked the idea of having one main image which both incorporated mindfullness / self-care and computing, and I think this image had it all!  Again it's farily muted in terms of the vibrancy of the colors, and it leads nicely onto the contact form which I kept very simple but still functional.  
ADD SCREEN GRAB OF CONTACT PAGE

#### 404 Error page

I was advised by my mentor to put a personalised error page so I used the same image for the Contact page and added a slightly humerous message including a link to the Home page.

#### Future Features

I would like to curve the edges of the grey background for each of the sections/divs just to soften the look a little, and I would love to expand on my experiences of the course so far and generally my journey into coding.  I really enjoy reading about other people's experiences and I would like to share what I have learnt along the way with the view of encouraging other people to take that first step.  I also feel that the layout of my site could look a little slicker, so I would change how the text plays over the image on the home page and make one section fade into the other on the other pages.

## Testing

### Validation Testing

1. [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

2. [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

### Cross Browser and Cross Device Testing

I have loaded the website in Chrome, Safari and Firefox. Each browser displayed the site as I designed it to and the responsive design is functioning as I intended.
I have used a number of mobile devices sizes in dev tools to ensure the website functions and appears OK across a number of devices.
I have inputed various formats of data into the form on the contact page, and the form requires all sections to be completed including a full email; if these things are not completed correctly it returns an error message. I have purposely not made the consent button as a required input.  When the form is submitted a new page is displayed thanking the user.
I've tested all the anchor elements for external links and ensured they open in a new browser tab.  I've also tested the internal anchor elements and ensured they go to the relevant pages within the site.
I've tested the user requirements as outlined in [Overall User Experience](#Overall-User-Experience)
I've ran my site through Lighthouse's audit https://web.dev.measure/ and the results are bellow:

### Bugs

1. Resolved bugs

2. Outstanding bugs

### Accessibility

I ran my site through Web Accessibility (https://www.webaccessibility.com/) and here are the results:

## Used MDN for general help
## Used snippits of text from the answers posed on this site to the question of how to fade in text on an image https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27883032/css-fade-out-picture-and-fade-in-text
## Used contact form code from Anya Hush on her first project Sunrise Yoga - https://github.com/Code-Institute-Submissions/sunrise-yoga
