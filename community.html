                <p>
                    This is just as important as <a href="setup.html">The Set-up</a> and <a href="course.html">The
                        Course</a>, especially if this is all completely new to you. I have come from a <em>totally</em>
                    different background, having never touched code before in my life.
                    The thing that is helping me through is The Community. Your community is personal to you - it can be
                    your friends, your family, colleagues, or the coding community as a whole.
                    With the Code Institute they have a forum for new and old students called Slack. At first it looks a
                    bit daunting as there are so many different groups you can join, but give it time and the community
                    will embrace you with open arms and be there for you in your darkest hour. Believe me on this one!
                    And remember, we all have our own pace of doing things, our own motivations and drive, so try not to
                    compare yourself to others. Hold yourself accountable, but when times get hard do lean on your coding buddies for their
                    knowledge, humour and support; you will find they are a very friendly bunch! A term that you'll hear a lot of is Imposter 
                    Syndrome and it is a very real thing.
                    If you've not heard of it check out the video at the end of this article. You'll also find a video featuring 
                    a student of Code Institute who shares her experiences with the course and why she decided to do the course.                   
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    And lastly, and by no means with any less importance remember this:
                    even software engineers who have been coding for years and years Google on a daily basis. Do not
                    expect to remember everything. Give it your best shot and believe in yourself - you've got this <i
