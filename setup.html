                    Whether you have one screen or four, your workspace needs to be conducive to maximising your
                    concentration and productivity.
                    I'm not talking about having your own office - for many of us that is not a possibility, but you
                    will need somewhere where you can sit comfortably in front of screen and keyboard with minimal
                    distractions.
                    For myself it's sitting at my dining room table which is free from clutter and unnecessary items.
                    A good rule of thumb is taking note of what is in your direct line of site as well as your
                    peripheral vision while you sit up straight in your chair in front of your computer.
                    If there is something which keeps drawing your eye to it and is proving a distraction, move it if
                    you can. On the flipside of this, some items are beneficial, but more on this later!

                <img class="computer-image" src="assets/images/code3.webp" alt="laptop screen showing lines of code">
                <h2><i class="fas fa-desktop"></i> Your computer</h2>
                <p>
                    This is entirely dependent on your budget, but what I will say is that you don't need anything
                    cutting edge - most laptops and computers will meet the minimum requirements to run your chosen
                    course.
                    I am working from a MacBook Pro and have an extra screen connected via a HDMI cable and find this
                    works well.
                    I also invested in a separate mouse and keyboard - the link to which can be found here: <a
                        href="https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/products/keyboards/mx-keys-mac-wireless-keyboard.html"
                        target="blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="Link to Logitech products">Logitech.</a> I find them
                    both more comfortable and intuitive than using the key and mouse pad on the laptop, but this will be
                    personal choice
                    and they are not needed in order for you to code!
                    The point here is don't be dicouraged if you read that only "real coders" have five nmonitors and
                    use a headset which wouldn't be out of place in NASA headquarters; trust me, it can be done with
                    neither of these things.

                <img class="plant-image" src="assets/images/plants.webp"
                    alt="Many potted plants surrounding a laptop on a white desk">
                <h2><i class="fas fa-leaf"></i> Your plant</h2>
                <p>
                    Or your piece or art, or ornament or picture! In other words, what is that one thing which when you
                    look at it gives you a sense of calm and brings you back to the present? When you are in the midst
                    of writing code it is
                    very easy to get lost in the process because it can be both amazing and the most intensely
                    frustrating! It will be beneficial to have something which will very quickly bring you back to the
                    now and encourage
                    you to take a deep breath, before continuing with whatever you were into.
                    For me, it's my Peace Lily - I love the vibrant, rich colour of the leaves, the delicate, small
                    white flowers and the knowledge that is has air-purifying properties.
                    If you do choose a plant, just be mindful that some can be poisonous to humans and animals, so
                    choose wisely!
